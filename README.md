# Algorithm Visualizer

## Sorting Algorithms
> Mergesort and Quicksort have some issues with the visualization. I will fix them soon.
### Bubble Sort:
* This is the simplest sorting algorithm.
* It repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
* Time complexity is O(n<sup>2</sup>) in the worst case.
* Space complexity is O(1).

### Selection Sort:
* This algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.
* Time complexity is O(n<sup>2</sup>) in the worst case.
* Space complexity is O(1).

### Insertion Sort:
* This algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly inserting an element from the unsorted part into its correct position in the sorted part.
* Time complexity is O(n<sup>2</sup>) in the worst case.
* Space complexity is O(1).

### Merge Sort:
* This algorithm divides the array into two halves, sorts them separately, and then merges the two sorted halves.
* Time complexity is O(n log n) in the worst case.
* Space complexity is O(n).

### Quick Sort:
* This algorithm picks an element as a pivot and partitions the array around the pivot.
* Time complexity is O(n<sup>2</sup>) in the worst case.
* Space complexity is O(log n).

## Searching Algorithms
###  Linear Search (Sequential Search):
* This is the simplest search algorithm.
* It sequentially checks each element in a list until a match is found.
* Works well for small lists or unsorted data.
* Time complexity is O(n) in the worst case.

### Binary Search:

* This is a more efficient search algorithm, but it requires sorted data.
* It repeatedly divides the search interval in half to find the desired item.
* Time complexity is O(log n) in the worst case.

### Jump Search:
* Jump Search divides the list into smaller blocks and checks these blocks to reduce the number of comparisons.
* Requires sorted data.
* Time complexity is O(âˆšn) in the worst case.

## Pathfinding Algorithms
### Dijkstra's Algorithm:
* This algorithm finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.
* It uses a priority queue to keep track of the next node to visit.

### A* Search:
* This algorithm is an extension of Dijkstra's algorithm.
* It uses a heuristic function to estimate the distance between the current node and the destination node.
* It uses a priority queue to keep track of the next node to visit.
* It is faster than Dijkstra's algorithm.

### Breadth-First Search:
* This algorithm finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.
* It uses a queue to keep track of the next node to visit.

### Depth-First Search:
* This algorithm finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.
* It uses a stack to keep track of the next node to visit.

## Data Structures
### Stack:
* A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
* It has two main operations: push and pop.
* It can be implemented using an array or a linked list.
* Time complexity of push and pop operations is O(1).
* Space complexity is O(n).

### Queue:
* A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
* It has two main operations: enqueue and dequeue.
* It can be implemented using an array or a linked list.
* Time complexity of enqueue and dequeue operations is O(1).
* Space complexity is O(n).

### Linked List:
* A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of nodes.
* Each node has a data field and a pointer to the next node.
* It can be implemented using a singly linked list or a doubly linked list.
* Time complexity of insertion and deletion operations is O(1).
* Space complexity is O(n).

## Recommendation System
### Collaborative Filtering:
> Will not be implemented
* This algorithm finds similar users based on their ratings and recommends items that they have rated highly.
* It uses the Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the similarity between users.
* It uses the weighted average of ratings to predict the ratings of items.

### Content-Based Filtering:
* This algorithm recommends items that are similar to the items that the user has liked in the past.
* It uses the cosine similarity to measure the similarity between items.
* It uses the weighted average of ratings to predict the ratings of items.
