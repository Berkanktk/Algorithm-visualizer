> Mergesort and Quicksort have some minor issues with the visualization. I will fix them soon.
### Bubble Sort
* This is the simplest sorting algorithm.
* It repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
* Time complexity is O(n<sup>2</sup>) in the worst case.
* Space complexity is O(1) in the worst case..

### Selection Sort
* This algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.
* Time complexity is O(n<sup>2</sup>) in the worst case.
* Space complexity is O(1) in the worst case.

### Insertion Sort
* This algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly inserting an element from the unsorted part into its correct position in the sorted part.
* Time complexity is O(n<sup>2</sup>) in the worst case.
* Space complexity is O(1) in the worst case.

### Merge Sort
* This algorithm divides the array into two halves, sorts them separately, and then merges the two sorted halves.
* Time complexity is O(n log n) in the worst case.
* Space complexity is O(n) in the worst case.

### Quick Sort
* This algorithm picks an element as a pivot and partitions the array around the pivot.
* Time complexity is O(n<sup>2</sup>) in the worst case.
* Space complexity is O(log n) in the worst case.

###  Linear Search (Sequential Search)
* This is the simplest search algorithm.
* It sequentially checks each element in a list until a match is found.
* Works well for small lists or unsorted data.
* Time complexity is O(n) in the worst case.

### Binary Search
* This is a more efficient search algorithm, but it requires sorted data.
* It repeatedly divides the search interval in half to find the desired item.
* Time complexity is O(log n) in the worst case.

### Jump Search
* Jump Search divides the list into smaller blocks and checks these blocks to reduce the number of comparisons.
* Requires sorted data.
* Time complexity is O(âˆšn) in the worst case.

### Exponential Search
* Exponential Search finds the range in which the desired item is located by jumping 2<sup>i</sup> elements in every iteration and then performs a binary search in that range.
* Requires sorted data.
* Time complexity is O(log n) in the worst case.

## Maze Generation Algorithms
![Maze-gen](static/assets/screenshots/maze-gen.gif)
### Binary Tree Algorithm
* Complexity: Simplest
* This algorithm creates a maze by repeatedly carving passages either to the north or to the east.
* It is a simple algorithm, but it produces mazes with a strong north-east bias.
* It doesn't require maintaining a complex state or backtracking.

### Randomized Backtracking (DFS)
* Complexity: Moderate
* Involves a stack and backtracking to create a maze
* It generates mazes with a single solution and a moderate level of complexity, but the paths tend to have a long and winding nature.
  
### Randomized Prim
* Complexity: More Complex
* This algorithm creates a maze by randomly selecting a wall from the list of walls that separate cells in the maze and removing it if the cells on both sides of the wall belong to different sets.
* It's more efficient in space utilization than the DFS method.
  
### Randomized Kruskal
* Complexity: Most Complex
* This algorithm creates a maze by randomly selecting a wall from the list of walls that separate cells in the maze and removing it if the cells on both sides of the wall belong to different sets.
* Produces mazes with a high degree of complexity and less bias compared to the other algorithms.

### Hunt and Kill
* Complexity: A little more complex than DFS
* This algorithm creates a maze by randomly selecting a cell and carving a passage in a random direction from that cell.
* It then performs a random walk, carving passages to unvisited cells until it reaches a dead end.

## Pathfinding Algorithms
![Pathfinding](static/assets/screenshots/pathfinding.gif)
### Dijkstra's Algorithm
* This algorithm finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.
* It uses a priority queue to keep track of the next node to visit.

### A* Search
* This algorithm is an extension of Dijkstra's algorithm.
* It uses a heuristic function to estimate the distance between the current node and the destination node.
* It uses a priority queue to keep track of the next node to visit.
* It is faster than Dijkstra's algorithm.

### Breadth-First Search
* This algorithm finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.
* It uses a queue to keep track of the next node to visit.

### Depth-First Search
* This algorithm finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.
* It uses a stack to keep track of the next node to visit.

## Data Structures

### Stack
* A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
* It has two main operations: push and pop.
* It can be implemented using an array or a linked list.
* Time complexity of push and pop operations is O(1).
* Space complexity is O(n).

### Queue
* A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
* It has two main operations: enqueue and dequeue.
* It can be implemented using an array or a linked list.
* Time complexity of enqueue and dequeue operations is O(1).
* Space complexity is O(n).

### Linked List
* A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of nodes.
* Each node has a data field and a pointer to the next node.
* It can be implemented using a singly linked list or a doubly linked list.
* Time complexity of insertion and deletion operations is O(1).
* Space complexity is O(n).

## Recommendation System
![Recommendation System](static/assets/screenshots/Recommendation.png)
### Collaborative Filtering
> Will not be implemented
* This algorithm finds similar users based on their ratings and recommends items that they have rated highly.
* It uses the Pearson correlation coefficient to measure the similarity between users.
* It uses the weighted average of ratings to predict the ratings of items.

### Content-Based Filtering
* This algorithm recommends items that are similar to the items that the user has liked in the past.
* It uses the cosine similarity to measure the similarity between items.
* It uses the weighted average of ratings to predict the ratings of items.

3. Format data 
4. Calculate TF-IDF
5. Calculate cosine similarity between images
6. Use labels to find similar images
7. Use similar images to find similar items
8. Use similar items to recommend items
